# AppUpdatesGUI
This is the GUI used by the appUpdates tools to allow user to select appropriate updates.

A version of this GUI tool is included in /Applications/Utilties/ of the AppUpdates respository.  You shouldn't need to get it from here unless you want to edit code or compile yourself. A compressed, .zip, version is available to download from here as well.
